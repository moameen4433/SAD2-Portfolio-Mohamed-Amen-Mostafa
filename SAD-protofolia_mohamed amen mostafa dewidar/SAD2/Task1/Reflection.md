# Reflection

### What I Learned

-   I learned how different classes in a system interact together
    through object references.
-   I understood how to structure a console-based application using
    menus and user input.
-   I practiced organizing data using ArrayLists and storing multiple
    types of objects.
-   I learned how linking objects (like Doctor, Patient, Nurse) makes
    the program more flexible.

### What Was Difficult

-   Understanding how user input flows between different menu choices.
-   Managing indices when selecting doctors, patients, and nurses.
-   Keeping track of how data is passed between constructors in
    different classes.
-   Differentiating between display methods and getters across multiple
    classes.

### What I Improved Compared to Last Time

-   I structured the code more cleanly and made class responsibilities
    clearer.
-   I understood better how to reuse object references across different
    features (appointments, prescriptions).
-   I improved my understanding of how to build a modular and scalable
    system.
-   I became more comfortable navigating between multiple files in the
    same project.
