# Reflection

## What I Learned

-   How the **Strategy Pattern** works in practice.
-   How to separate payment logic from business logic (`Order` class).
-   How interfaces help switch algorithms dynamically at runtime.
-   Better understanding of modular design and single responsibility.

## What Was Difficult

-   Following the data flow between `Order` and the selected strategy.
-   Understanding how each strategy processes payments differently.
-   Making sure each class has a clear job without mixing
    responsibilities.
-   Understanding how user choices or tests pick the strategy.

## What I Improved Compared to Last Time

-   More confident applying design patterns in Java.
-   Better structuring of multi-file Java projects.
-   Improved clarity and modularity in class design.
-   Better reasoning about code reuse and algorithm separation.
